## VI Torneo Caribeño de Jugadores Virtuales “ICPChallenge” 

The tournament consists on programming virtual players capable of automatic game playing, i.e. without human interaction. Every 2016 ACM-ICPC Caribbean finalist team may submit one virtual player implementation. A virtual player must be implemented in Java using a single file containing the source code describing a single class. To submit a virtual player, the source code must be sent before november 7 at the address acm-icpc@uci.cu. The message should contain the subject: ICPChallenge "team official name" (for example: ICPChallenge "MyTeam").
